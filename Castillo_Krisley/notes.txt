For the changes, I opted for a minimalist style with a monochromatic yet warm color scheme.

I decided to not put a header to encourage the viewer to scroll down.

I opted to follow the website's original sequence of segments as I thought it was very effective in informing the viewer of The AreaTwo's processes.

The first segment is dedicated to welcoming the viewer to The AreaTwo.

I wanted to stay faithful to the second segment as I thought it to be really effective. The changes made was to keep the redesign within its style.

For the third segment, I decided to put the processes of the images side-by-side.

The fourth segment is very faithful to the original website's. The graphics used were also from the website as it is very effective in informing the viewer.

The same went for the fifth, sixth, and final segments- all being faithful to the original design while keeping within the redesign's style.
